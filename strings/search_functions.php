// strstr()         Searches for a substring in a string and returns the portion of the

// preferable because it is faster.
// stristr()        A case-insensitive version of strstr().
// strchr()         Returns the portion of the string before the first occurrence of the
// needle.
// strpos()         Returns the position of the first occurrence of the needle. 4
// stripos()        A case-insensitive version of strpos().
// strspn()         Finds the length of the initial segment of a string consisting entirely
// of characters contained within a given mask. 5
// strcspn()        Returns the length of the initial segment of subject that does
// not contain any of the characters in the mask. In other words, it
// searches for the first occurrence of any of the mask letters in the
// string and returns the number of characters that exist before it is found.
