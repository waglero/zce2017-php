// Regular expressions are delimited by characters that appear at the beginning and end of
// each pattern in your expression. Usually the forward slash is used, but # and ! are also
// common.
// Any character can be used, but the delimiter will need to be escaped inside your
// expressions, so it is standard to choose a delimiter that is not likely to occur in your search
// expression. For example, if you’re going to be searching directories to find those which
// match a pattern, the forward slash character might not be the best choice of delimiter.
