// An abstract class cannot be constructed; we cannot create a new object from the
// class Paintings.
// Abstract classes are intended to be extended. A class that extends an abstract class
// must define all the methods that are marked abstract in the parent class. If the child class
// does not implement the methods, they must also be marked as abstract, and so the child
// class will also be abstract.
// When a child class extends an abstract class, it must define the abstract methods
// with either the same or a less restrictive visibility.
// The signature of the methods declared in the child class must match the abstract
// methodâ€™s signature. This means that the number and type of required (not optional)
// arguments to the method must be the same.
